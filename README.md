Hello my name is David Sanchez I'm 22 years old, I've
Lived in Las Vegas for 15 years I've been self employed 
I co-owned a computer and phone repair shop with my parents. I was in-charge 
Of fixing all the computers for Us and 18 other shops around town.
Along with merchandise and many other things. Looking now
For a Job that is team oriented since I enjoy working with others,
Believe it's time i do something different. I'm very ambitious and set goals for myself
Try to have everything ready to the best of my abilities. I don't mind 
Asking for help when needed because I know I don't know everything, love learning 
New things. I can drive 10 wheelers and forklifts, willing to learn anything else if I'm 
Taught how to. Best way to contact me would be (702) 326-9210
